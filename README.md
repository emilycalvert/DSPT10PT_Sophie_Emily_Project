# Satellite Image Classification Project

This repository contains all the codes and results of our Satellite Image Classification Project. In this project, we trained a ResNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on satellite images to classify different landscapes, such as deserts, water bodies, green areas, and cloudy scenes.

## Contents

- Data: This folder contains the dataset used for this project. The dataset includes various types of satellite images, all separated into four distinct folders according to the landscape type they represent.

- Preprocessing and EDA: This Jupyter notebook contains all the preprocessing steps and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) done on the satellite images.

- Notebook: This Jupyter notebook contains the definition, training, and evaluation of the CNN model used for classifying the satellite images.

- Archive: This zip file contains the saved model that has been trained and can be used for making predictions on new satellite images.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   
2. Install the required Python packages:

3. Open and run the `preprocessing_and_eda.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to understand how the data was preprocessed and explored.

5. Open and run the `model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to understand how the model was trained and evaluated.

6. Use the saved model in `model_archive.zip` to make predictions on new satellite images.

## Results

Our model achieved a validation accuracy of  and test accuracy of .
